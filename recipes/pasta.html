    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
    <p>To make creamy white sauce pasta, start by boiling pasta in salted water until al dente, then drain and set aside. In a pan, melt butter and sauté minced garlic until fragrant. Add all-purpose flour and cook for a minute, stirring continuously. Gradually pour in warm milk, whisking to avoid lumps, and let it thicken. Season with salt, black pepper, and oregano, then mix in grated cheese for extra creaminess. Toss in cooked pasta and mix well to coat evenly. Optionally, add sautéed vegetables like bell peppers, mushrooms, or sweet corn for added flavor. Serve hot, garnished with chili flakes and fresh herbs.</p>
